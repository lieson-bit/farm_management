With old age there's is wisdom, but What will wisdom profit a man at 70 or 80 when his life is finishing.  I don't want to grow old to be wise because I make most of my decisions when am young. This is one of the reasons I will fear God. I'll study instructions and apply it.

Any instruction God gives, obey it. Act foolish in obedience to God and see how God make you wise when you confront life outside God
